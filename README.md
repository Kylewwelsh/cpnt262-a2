- Repo created on GitHub
- Noticed that I accidentally gave CPNT260 Assignment 1 repo the cpnt262-a2 so had to change that
- I have decided to use my CPNT260 gallery for this assignment, <strong><em><u>but</u></em></strong> because my CPNT260-A3 was part of a multi page gallery, I am just going to copy over the code for ease of access for Tony
- Directory set up; css, js, html files created
- Doctype added to html, strict mode added to js
- To get in better habits for the group project I will be practicing committing my code more often with this
