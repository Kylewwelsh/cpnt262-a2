- Repo created on GitHub
- Noticed that I accidentally gave CPNT260 Assignment 1 repo the cpnt262-a2 so had to change that
- I have decided to use my CPNT260 gallery for this assignment, <strong><em><u>but</u></em></strong> because my CPNT260-A3 was part of a multi page gallery, I am just going to copy over the code for ease of access for Tony
- Directory set up; css, js, html files created
- Doctype added to html, strict mode added to js
- To get in better habits for the group project I will be practicing committing my code more often with this
- css and html from cpnt260-a3 copied over, left the css for the other pages from cpnt260 out of the copy and paste
- media queries and hover declarations that were in the original gallery have been taken out
- figures and figcaptions have been taken out of the html, div tag for the old gallery changed to a main tag
- going to start with updating the nav from the old assignment 
- The secondary nav that was in the old assignment has been taken out, unneeded classes taken out, font awesome script added, link for browser tab icon added
- css started for the new nav, new nav will just end up being a hamburger menu
