- Repo created on GitHub
- Noticed that I accidentally gave CPNT260 Assignment 1 repo the cpnt262-a2 so had to change that
- I have decided to use my CPNT260 gallery for this assignment, <strong><em><u>but</u></em></strong> because my CPNT260-A3 was part of a multi page gallery, I am just going to copy over the code for ease of access for Tony
- Directory set up; css, js, html files created
- Doctype added to html, strict mode added to js
- To get in better habits for the group project I will be practicing committing my code more often with this
- css and html from cpnt260-a3 copied over, left the css for the other pages from cpnt260 out of the copy and paste
- media queries and hover declarations that were in the original gallery have been taken out
- figures and figcaptions have been taken out of the html, div tag for the old gallery changed to a main tag
- going to start with updating the nav from the old assignment 
- The secondary nav that was in the old assignment has been taken out, unneeded classes taken out, font awesome script added, link for browser tab icon added
- css started for the new nav, new nav will just end up being a hamburger menu
- Social icons had to be given a color of black (usually this is redundant) as the default color for them was the default for a link
- tab icon svg opacity changed to 1 so color would come out
- images added to the directory (forgot to mention that in the commit, whoops)
- just realized it was stupid to style the i icons when I can just make all the links black
- a "socials" class added to the ul for the social media icons just in case I need to style the ul's separately
- inline added to socials, padding added to li's, bullet points taken out of the ul's
- banner added, footer height changed from px to rem to match banner, hamburger icon added
- button added and styled for hamburger menu, menu options and socials given 2rem font size
- border and outline taken off button, (might put the outline back on so it looks pressed but will decide later)
- background color added to menu options, nav set to 100vh height and 25rem width, margin-top set to 0 to for nav-options to connect nav to banner
- color and background color added to button on hover
- 'x' icon added to button, set to display none
- nav now set to display none, footer given absolute position with bottom: 0, header commented out for now
- class added to the hamburger icon to separate it from the x icon in the button, styles added to:
  - display x icon
  - hide hamburger icon
  - display nav options
- Hamburger menu completed, played around with it in this [codepen](https://codepen.io/kylewwelsh/full/yLVEYOK) to learn the information from DEV
- Links given an href of # (except socials)
